            <h3>History background</h3>
            <p>
              Warsaw was founded as early as 1280 year by the dukes of Mazovia.
              The city has had a particularly tumultuous history for an European
              city. It experienced numerous plagues, invasions, and devastating
              fires. Warsaw suffered under various occupations - French
              (Napoleon I created Dutchy of Warsaw in 1807), Russian and German
              ( II World War). Probably more of those occupational influences
              would have been visible if not to the 85% of city's area was
              destryed by Nazis in 1945. Throughout the next couple of years
              after the war Warsaw's residents were proudly rebuilding what they
              lost but yet again Warsaw ended up under the Soviet occupation up
              until late 80's.
