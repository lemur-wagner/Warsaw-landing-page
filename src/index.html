              Warsaw was founded as early as 1280 by the dukes of Mazovia. The
              city has had a particularly tumultuous history for a European
              city. It experienced numerous plagues, invasions, and devastating
              fires. Warsaw suffered under various occupations - French
              (Napoleon I created Dutchy of Warsaw in 1807), Russian and German
              ( II World War). Probably more of those occupational influences
              would have been seen if not to the 85% of Warsaw been destryed by
              Nazis in 1945. Throughout the next couple of years after the war
              Warsaw proudly rebuilt what it lost but yet again endup under the
              Soviet occupation up until late 80's.
